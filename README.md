## 📍 Overview

The **Employee Management System** is a RESTful API built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB** for managing employee records. It enables efficient CRUD operations on employee data such as adding new employees, retrieving employee information, updating records, and deleting them.

The system provides a robust backend for handling employee management efficiently, leveraging MongoDB for storing and retrieving data with **Mongoose** as the ODM.

## 👾 Features

- **Get All Employees**: Retrieve a list of all employees.
- **Get Employee by ID**: Fetch details of a specific employee by their unique ID.
- **Create Employee**: Add new employees to the database.
- **Update Employee**: Modify details of existing employees.
- **Delete Employee**: Remove employee records from the system.
