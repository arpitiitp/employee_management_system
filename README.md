Employee Management System - Backend<br>
This Employee Management System is built using Node.js with Express.js and MongoDB as the database, utilizing Mongoose for object data modeling (ODM). It provides an API that allows users to manage employee records through basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The system enables efficient employee data management, and all API endpoints are tested and accessible using Postman. The available operations include:

- Get all employees: Retrieve a list of all employees.<br>
- Get employee by ID: Fetch details of a specific employee by their ID.<br>
- Create employee: Add new employee records.<br>
- Update employee: Modify existing employee details.<br>
- Delete employee: Remove an employee from the system.<br>
The project provides a robust and scalable backend solution for managing employee data.
